## Overview
Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.

Create a responsive portfolio using Bootstrap CSS Framework, which includes links to About me, Portfolio, and Contact sites. 

## Acceptance Criteria
Create three html files: index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html.

Each page must have valid and correct HTML.

Use semantic html.

Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

   * navbar - must be consistent on each page, contains links to home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries

Sticky footer

## UI/UX Consideration

Fav Icon for Portfolio site added

Font - Acquired from Google Font (Poiret One and Lobster)

Main Colour Palette used - #343a40,  rgba(116, 115, 113, 0.438), rgba(0, 0, 0, .5)(Shadow) Orange, and White.

The Content for each page is kept in a light grey container so there is some contrast with the background image.

## Testing

Only Main functionality tested

As a User, When I click any of the navbar links, user is directed to the appropriate linked page

As a System, When screen size is scaled to mobile friendly, the content is responsive

As a System, When screen is scrolled, the footer should stay in place on the screen
